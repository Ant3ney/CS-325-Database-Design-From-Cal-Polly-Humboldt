# CS 325 From Cal Polly Humboldt

This repo is meant to serve as a place to document what I learned in CS 325 from Cal Polly Humboldt

## CS 325 is about database design?

The following was ripped from the course syllabus

Introduction to database design and implementation. Relational model, entity-relationship model
and diagrams, converting a model to a schema, elementary Structured Query Language (SQL), normalization.
This course is an introduction to relational database implementation and design; it will enable you to realize the potential of
available database management systems (DBMS) software by teaching you how to model and design a database that will
serve as a firm foundation for database applications. You will also learn and extensively practice using the fourth-generation
language Structured Query Language (SQL), used as a data definition language to create and destroy database tables, as a
data manipulation language to maintain and query the data within database tables, and as a data control language to protect
and enhance the integrity of the data within database tables. You will learn the fundamentals of the relational model, entity-
relationship modeling, converting an entity-relationship model into a database schema/design, normalization,
implementation of a database schema/design, and some fundamentals of transactions and concurrency management.
